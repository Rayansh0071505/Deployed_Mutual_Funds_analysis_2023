What problem i face while making this project in app.py---

-> in app.py use modified_data for loading and preprocessing , try to avoid adding new columns in data , alternative use that
   preprocessing and modified the data in different python file

-> for any preprocessing and any changes try to do inside function not openly
-> in app.py while deploying in streamlit try to use set before everything like set_xlabel , see gpt for reference
-> while deploying showing error so "ax.set_xticks(X, rotation='vertical')" so to solve it we do
   "ax.set_xticks(X, rotation=90)

Things must do 
-> add requirement.txt file so while deploying file can install all dependencies
-> for deploying use streamlit instead of flask and for deployment website try to use render its more easy and good
